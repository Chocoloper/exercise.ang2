  *  Get yourself comfy with the angular2quickstarter or https://github.com/Chocoloper/exercise.ang2/tree/master/template

* Task 1 [flavors]
  * Step a) Build 2 Child-Components (many examples online) (1 Point)
  * Step b) Enhance webApp.ts with @Routeconfig to load Child-Component & change the webApp.html with links to enter Child-Components
  * Step c) Inject a Service into both Child-Components (1 Point)
  * Step d) Enhance the child-components in a way so that a user can enter some object with the help of the first component and the second component should display all objects. Hint: That's what the service is for! (1 Point)

  * Step e1) Use the HTTP-modul of angular2 to retrieve some start objects into your service (1 Point)
  * Step e2) Add a tooltip directive for your objects or a input[trimmer] directive for your input (1 Point)

* Flavors:
  * I)   Your team need to write an webshop and you are responsible for the components where the admin can enter products into the catalogue and can view all entered products.
  * II)  Your task is to collect issues. To collect these your idea was to write a fast angular 2 prototype where you can enter all your issues and another component where you can view all issues.
  * III) Cookies. You love Cookies. You know like ten thousand cookie recipes. Write an angular2 app which enables you to enter all the cookie recipes you are loving so much and create another component which lists them all! Cookies are great.
  * IV)  I think you got it? Create your own flavour which sticks to the steps in Task 1.
